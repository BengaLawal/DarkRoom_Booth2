Work in progress

The picture and Video buttons are the only buttons that currently works.

You are able to take a picture/video with the options of accepting, retaking, or canceling the picture.

Accept - opens to a keyboard page where the user types in an email address. 
If "Enter" is pressed, the picture/video is saved and sent to the address.
If "Cancel" is pressed, you return to the home page without saving the picture.

Retake - retakes the picture/video, and prompts you with all three options again.

Cancel - return to the home page.

Work in progress

The picture button is the only button that currently works.

Picture

  You are able to take a picture with the options of accepting, retaking, or canceling the picture.
  
  Accept - opens to a keyboard page where the user types in an email address. 
           If "Enter" is pressed, the picture is saved and sent to the address.
           If "Cancel" is pressed, you return to the home page without saving the picture.
           
  Retake - retakes the picture, and prompts you with all three options again.
  
  Cancel - return to the home page.
